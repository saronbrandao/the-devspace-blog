# Introduction to HTML - The Backbone of Web Development

HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the backbone of every web page. It provides the structure and semantics necessary for displaying content on the internet. In this blog post, we will introduce you to the basics of HTML and how it is used in web development.

## What is HTML?

HTML is a markup language that uses a set of tags to define the structure and layout of web content. These tags represent different elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, images, links, and more. HTML documents are comprised of nested tags, forming a tree-like structure known as the Document Object Model (DOM).

Here's an example of a simple HTML document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="An image">
    <a href="https://example.com">Visit Example.com</a>
  </body>
</html>
```

## HTML Tags and Elements
HTML tags are used to define the elements within an HTML document. Each tag serves a specific purpose and carries attributes that provide additional information. Here are some commonly used HTML tags:

- `<h1>` to `<h6>`: Headings of different levels.
- `<p>`: Paragraphs of text.
- `<a>`: Links to other web pages.
- `<img>`: Images.
- `<ul>` and `<li>`: Unordered lists.
- `<ol>` and `<li>`: Ordered lists.
- `<div>`: A container for grouping elements.
- `<span>`: Inline container for styling elements.
- `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, `<td>`: Tables and their respective elements.

## Semantic HTML
Semantic HTML is the practice of using HTML elements that convey meaning and improve the accessibility and structure of web content. By choosing the appropriate semantic elements, such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`, you can enhance the organization and understanding of your web page.

## Conclusion
HTML is the foundation of web development. Understanding the basics of HTML tags, elements, and semantics is crucial for creating well-structured web pages. In future blog posts, we will explore more advanced HTML techniques and features.
